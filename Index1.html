  <h2>Physical characteristics</h2>
  <h3>Size and shape</h3>
  <p>The shape of Earth is nearly spherical. There is a small flattening at
    the poles and bulging around the equator due to Earth's rotation. Therefore, a better
    approximation of Earth's shape is an oblate spheroid, whose equatorial diameter is 43
    kilometres larger than the pole-to-pole diameter.

  <h3>Chemical composition</h3>
  <p>Earth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5,970 Yg). It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%),
    silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminum (1.4%), with the
    remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to mass segregation, the core region is estimated
    to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than
    1% trace elements. The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur,
    and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than
    1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia,
    potash, and soda.</p>

  <h3>Internal structure</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or
      physical (rheological) properties.</li>
    <li> The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous
      solid mantle.</li>
    <li>The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity. The thickness of the
      crust varies from about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) under the oceans to 30–50 km (19–31 mi) for the continents. </li>
    <li> The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, which
      is divided into independently moving tectonic plates</li>

  <h3> Heat</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232.</li>
    <li>At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000 °C (10,830 °F),and the pressure could reach 360 GPa
      (52 million psi).</li>
    <li>Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in
      Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was
      much higher.</li>
    <li>At approximately 3 Gyr, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the
      rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous
      rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.</li>

  <h3>Tectonic plates</h3>
  <p>Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates
    are rigid segments that move relative to each other<br> at one of three boundaries types: at convergent boundaries,
    two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and <br> at transform boundaries,
    two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity,
    mountain-building,<br> and oceanic trench formation can occur. The tectonic plates ride on top of the
    asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle<br> that can flow and move along with the
    plates.</p>

  <h3>Surface</h3>
  <p>The total surface area of Earth is about 510 million km2 (197 million sq mi)Of this, 70.8%,
    or 361.13 million km2 (139.43 million sq mi), is<br> below sea level and covered by ocean water.Below
    the ocean's surface are much of the continental shelf, mountains, volcanoes,oceanic trenches,
    submarine<br> canyons, oceanic plateaus, abyssal plains, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system.
    The remaining 29.2%, or 148.94 million km2<br> (57.51 million sq mi), not covered by water has terrain
    that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and<br>
    other landforms. The elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of −418 m (−1,371 ft)
    at the Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude of 8,848 m (29,029 ft) at the top of Mount Everest. The mean
    height of land above sea level is about 797 m (2,615 ft).</p>

  <h3>Comparision Between Gravitational field and Magnetic field:-</h3>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The gravity of Earth is the acceleration that is imparted<br> to objects due to the
        distribution of mass within Earth.<br> Near Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration
        is<br> approximately 9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2). Local differences <br>in topography, geology, and
        deeper tectonic structure <br>cause local and broad, regional differences in<br> Earth's gravitational
        field, known as gravity anomalies.</td>
      <td>The main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core,<br>
        the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of <br>
        thermally and compositionally driven convectioninto electrical and <br>
        magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core,<br>
        through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is,approximately,<br>
        a dipole.The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's <br>
        geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the <br>
        magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05×10−5 T,with a magnetic<br>
        dipole moment of 7.79×1022 Am2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly <br>
        6% per century.</td>
